                    <b>Who Was Isaac Newton?</b><br>
                    Isaac Newton was a physicist and mathematician who developed the principles of modern physics,<br>
                     including the laws of motion and is credited as one of the great minds of the 17th-century Scientific Revolution. 
                    <br><br>
                    In 1687, he published his most acclaimed work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical<br>
                    Principles of Natural Philosophy), which has been called the single most influential book on physics. In 1705,<br>
                    he was knighted by Queen Anne of England, making him Sir Isaac Newton.

                    <br>
                    <b>Early Life and Family</b> <br>
                    Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. Using the "old" Julian calendar,<br>
                     Newton's birth date is sometimes displayed as December 25, 1642.
                    <br><br>
                    Newton was the only son of a prosperous local farmer, also named Isaac, who died three months before he<br>
                    was born. A premature baby born tiny and weak, Newton was not expected to survive.
                    <br><br>
                    When he was 3 years old, his mother, Hannah Ayscough Newton, remarried a well-to-do minister, Barnabas Smith,<br>
                    and went to live with him, leaving young Newton with his maternal grandmother. 
                    <br><br>
                    The experience left an indelible imprint on Newton, later manifesting itself as an acute sense of insecurity.<br>
                    He anxiously obsessed over his published work, defending its merits with irrational behavior.
                    <br><br>
                    At age 12, Newton was reunited with his mother after her second husband died. She brought along her three small <br>
                    children from her second marriage.

                    <b>Isaac Newton's Education</b> <br>
                    Newton was enrolled at the King's School in Grantham, a town in Lincolnshire, where he lodged with a local apothecary<br>
                     and was introduced to the fascinating world of chemistry.
                    <br><BR>
                    His mother pulled him out of school at age 12. Her plan was to make him a farmer and have him tend the farm. Newton<br>
                     failed miserably, as he found farming monotonous. Newton was soon sent back to King's School to finish his basic education.

                    <b>Scientific Revolution</b>
                    <br><br>
                    When Newton arrived at Cambridge, the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century was already in full force. The heliocentric<br>
                    view of the universe—theorized by astronomers Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler, and later refined by Galileo—was<br>
                    well known in most European academic circles.
                    <br><br>
                    Philosopher René Descartes had begun to formulate a new concept of nature as an intricate, impersonal and inert machine.<br>
                    Yet, like most universities in Europe, Cambridge was steeped in Aristotelian philosophy and a view of nature resting on a<br>
                    geocentric view of the universe, dealing with nature in qualitative rather than quantitative terms.
                    <br><br>
                    During his first three years at Cambridge, Newton was taught the standard curriculum but was fascinated with the more<br>
                    advanced science. All his spare time was spent reading from the modern philosophers. The result was a less-than-stellar<br>
                    performance, but one that is understandable, given his dual course of study.
                    <br><br>
                    It was during this time that Newton kept a second set of notes, entitled "Quaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae" ("Certain<br>
                    Philosophical Questions"). The "Quaestiones" reveal that Newton had discovered the new concept of nature that provided<br>
                    the framework for the Scientific Revolution. Though Newton graduated without honors or distinctions, his efforts won him<br>
                    the title of scholar and four years of financial support for future education.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1665, the bubonic plague that was ravaging Europe had come to Cambridge, forcing the university to close. After a<br>
                    two-year hiatus, Newton returned to Cambridge in 1667 and was elected a minor fellow at Trinity College, as he was <br>
                    still not considered a standout scholar.
                    <br><br>
                    In the ensuing years, his fortune improved. Newton received his Master of Arts degree in 1669, before he was 27. During<br>
                    this time, he came across Nicholas Mercator's published book on methods for dealing with infinite series. 
                    <br><br>
                    Newton quickly wrote a treatise, De Analysi, expounding his own wider-ranging results. He shared this with friend and mentor<br>
                     Isaac Barrow, but didn't include his name as author.
                    <br><br>
                    In June 1669, Barrow shared the unaccredited manuscript with British mathematician John Collins. In August 1669, Barrow<br>
                     identified its author to Collins as "Mr. Newton ... very young ... but of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things." 
                    <br><br>
                    Newton's work was brought to the attention of the mathematics community for the first time. Shortly afterward, Barrow<br>
                    resigned his Lucasian professorship at Cambridge, and Newton assumed the chair.

                        <br><br>
                        Newton made discoveries in optics, motion and mathematics. Newton theorized that white light was a composite of all colors<br>
                         of the spectrum, and that light was composed of particles. 
                        <br><bR>
                        His momentous book on physics, Principia, contains information on nearly all of the essential concepts of physics except energy,<br>
                        ultimately helping him to explain the laws of motion and the theory of gravity. Along with mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von<br>
                        Leibniz, Newton is credited for developing essential theories of calculus.

                        <br><b>Isaac Newton Inventions</b><br>
                        Newton's first major public scientific achievement was designing and constructing a reflecting telescope in 1668. As a professor<br>
                        at Cambridge, Newton was required to deliver an annual course of lectures and chose optics as his initial topic. He used his<br>
                        telescope to study optics and help prove his theory of light and color. 
                        <BR><BR>
                        The Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope in 1671, and the organization's interest encouraged<br>
                        Newton to publish his notes on light, optics and color in 1672. These notes were later published as part of Newton's Opticks: Or,<br>
                        A treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>The Apple Myth </b><br>
                        Between 1665 and 1667, Newton returned home from Trinity College to pursue his private study, as school was closed due to<br>
                        the Great Plague. Legend has it that, at this time, Newton experienced his famous inspiration of gravity with the falling apple.<br>
                        According to this common myth, Newton was sitting under an apple tree when a fruit fell and hit him on the head, inspiring<bR>
                        him to suddenly come up with the theory of gravity. 
                        <br><br>
                        While there is no evidence that the apple actually hit Newton on the head, he did see an apple fall from a tree, leading him to<br>
                         wonder why it fell straight down and not at an angle. Consequently, he began exploring the theories of motion and gravity.
                        <br><br>
                        It was during this 18-month hiatus as a student that Newton conceived many of his most important insights—including the<br>
                        method of infinitesimal calculus, the foundations for his theory of light and color, and the laws of planetary motion—that<br>
                        eventually led to the publication of his physics book Principia and his theory of gravity. 
                        <br><Br>
                        <b>Isaac Newton’s Laws of Motion</b><br>
                        In 1687, following 18 months of intense and effectively nonstop work, Newton published Philosophiae Naturalis Principia<br>
                         Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), most often known as Principia. 
                        <br><br>
                        Principia is said to be the single most influential book on physics and possibly all of science. Its publication immediately raised<br>
                         Newton to international prominence.
                        <br><br>
                        Principia offers an exact quantitative description of bodies in motion, with three basic but important laws of motion: 
                        <br>
                        <h3>
                            First Law<br>
                            A stationary body will stay stationary unless an external force is applied to it.
                        </h3>

                        <h3>
                            Second Law<br>
                            Force is equal to mass times acceleration, and a change in motion (i.e., change in speed) is proportional to the force applied.

                        <b>Newton and the Theory of Gravity</b><br><br>
                        Newton’s three basic laws of motion outlined in Principia helped him arrive at his theory of gravity. Newton’s law of universal<br>
                        gravitation states that two objects attract each other with a force of gravitational attraction that’s proportional to their masses<br>
                        and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.
                        <br><BR>
                        These laws helped explain not only elliptical planetary orbits but nearly every other motion in the universe: how the planets are<br>
                        kept in orbit by the pull of the sun’s gravity; how the moon revolves around Earth and the moons of Jupiter revolve around it;<br>
                        and how comets revolve in elliptical orbits around the sun. 
                        <BR><BR>
                        They also allowed him to calculate the mass of each planet, calculate the flattening of the Earth at the poles and the bulge at<br>
                        the equator, and how the gravitational pull of the sun and moon create the Earth’s tides. In Newton's account, gravity kept the<br>
                        universe balanced, made it work, and brought heaven and Earth together in one great equation.
                        <bR><BR>  
                        <b>Isaac Newton & Robert Hooke</b><br><br>
                        Not everyone at the Royal Academy was enthusiastic about Newton’s discoveries in optics and 1672 publication of Opticks:<br> 
                        Or, A treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light. Among the dissenters was Robert Hooke,<br>
                         one of the original members of the Royal Academy and a scientist who was accomplished in a number of areas, including<br>
                         mechanics and optics. 
                        <bR><BR>  
                        While Newton theorized that light was composed of particles, Hooke believed it was composed of waves. Hooke quickly<br>
                         condemned Newton's paper in condescending terms, and attacked Newton's methodology and conclusions.
                        <bR><BR>  
                        Hooke was not the only one to question Newton's work in optics. Renowned Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens and a number<br>
                        of French Jesuits also raised objections. But because of Hooke's association with the Royal Society and his own work in optics,<br>
                        his criticism stung Newton the worst. 
                        <bR><BR>  
                        Unable to handle the critique, he went into a rage—a reaction to criticism that was to continue throughout his life. Newton denied<br>
                         Hooke's charge that his theories had any shortcomings and argued the importance of his discoveries to all of science. 
                        <bR><BR>  
                        In the ensuing months, the exchange between the two men grew more acrimonious, and soon Newton threatened to quit the<br>
                         Royal Society altogether. He remained only when several other members assured him that the Fellows held him in high esteem.
                        <bR><BR>  
                        The rivalry between Newton and Hooke would continue for several years thereafter. Then, in 1678, Newton suffered a complete<br>
                        nervous breakdown and the correspondence abruptly ended. The death of his mother the following year caused him<br>
                        to become even more isolated, and for six years he withdrew from intellectual exchange except when others<br>
                        initiated correspondence, which he always kept short.
                        <bR><BR>  
                        During his hiatus from public life, Newton returned to his study of gravitation and its effects on the orbits of planets.<br>
                        Ironically, the impetus that put Newton on the right direction in this study came from Robert Hooke. 
                        <bR><BR>  
                        In a 1679 letter of general correspondence to Royal Society members for contributions, Hooke wrote to Newton and<br>
                        brought up the question of planetary motion, suggesting that a formula involving the inverse squares might explain the<br>
                        attraction between planets and the shape of their orbits.

                        Subsequent exchanges transpired before Newton quickly broke off the correspondence once again. But Hooke's idea was soon<br>
                        incorporated into Newton's work on planetary motion, and from his notes it appears he had quickly drawn his own<br>
                        conclusions by 1680, though he kept his discoveries to himself.
                        <bR><BR>  
                        In early 1684, in a conversation with fellow Royal Society members Christopher Wren and Edmond Halley, Hooke made his<br>
                        case on the proof for planetary motion. Both Wren and Halley thought he was on to something, but pointed out that<br>
                        a mathematical demonstration was needed. 
                        <bR><BR>  
                        In August 1684, Halley traveled to Cambridge to visit with Newton, who was coming out of his seclusion. Halley idly asked<br>
                        him what shape the orbit of a planet would take if its attraction to the sun followed the inverse square of the distance<br>
                        between them (Hooke's theory).
                        <bR><BR>  
                        Newton knew the answer, due to his concentrated work for the past six years, and replied, "An ellipse." Newton claimed<br>
                        to have solved the problem some 18 years prior, during his hiatus from Cambridge and the plague, but he was unable<br>
                        to find his notes. Halley persuaded him to work out the problem mathematically and offered to pay all costs so<br>
                        that the ideas might be published, which it was, in Newton’s Principia.
                        <bR><BR>  
                        Upon the publication of the first edition of Principia in 1687, Robert Hooke immediately accused Newton of plagiarism,<br>
                        claiming that he had discovered the theory of inverse squares and that Newton had stolen his work. The charge was<br>
                        unfounded, as most scientists knew, for Hooke had only theorized on the idea and had never brought it to any level of proof. 
                        <bR><BR>  
                        Newton, however, was furious and strongly defended his discoveries. He withdrew all references to Hooke in his notes and<br>
                        threatened to withdraw from publishing the subsequent edition of Principia altogether. 
                        <bR><BR>  
                        Halley, who had invested much of himself in Newton's work, tried to make peace between the two men. While Newton<br>
                        begrudgingly agreed to insert a joint acknowledgment of Hooke's work (shared with Wren and Halley) in his discussion<br>
                        of the law of inverse squares, it did nothing to placate Hooke.
                        <bR><BR>  
                        As the years went on, Hooke's life began to unravel. His beloved niece and companion died the same year that Principia was<br>
                        published, in 1687. As Newton's reputation and<br>
                        fame grew, Hooke's declined, causing him to become even more bitter and loathsome toward his rival. 
                        <bR><BR>  
                        To the very end, Hooke took every opportunity he could to offend Newton. Knowing that his rival would soon be elected president<br>
                        of the Royal Society, Hooke refused to retire until the year of his death, in 1703.

                        <b>Newton and Alchemy </b><br><br>
                        Following the publication of Principia, Newton was ready for a new direction in life. He no longer found contentment in his<br>
                        position at Cambridge and was becoming more involved in other issues. 
                        <br><BR>
                        He helped lead the resistance to King James II's attempts to reinstitute Catholic teaching at Cambridge, and in 1689 he was<br>
                        elected to represent Cambridge in Parliament.
                        <br><BR>
                        While in London, Newton acquainted himself with a broader group of intellectuals and became acquainted with political<br>
                        philosopher John Locke. Though many of the scientists on the continent continued to teach the mechanical world<br>
                        according to Aristotle, a young generation of British scientists became captivated with Newton's new view of<br>
                        the physical world and recognized him as their leader. 
                        <br><BR>
                        One of these admirers was Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, a Swiss mathematician whom Newton befriended while in London.
                        <br><BR>
                        However, within a few years, Newton fell into another nervous breakdown in 1693. The cause is open to speculation: his<br>
                        disappointment over not being appointed to a higher position by England's new monarchs, William III and Mary II,<br>
                        or the subsequent loss of his friendship with Duillier; exhaustion from being overworked; or perhaps chronic<br>
                        mercury poisoning after decades of alchemical research. 
                        <br><BR>
                        It's difficult to know the exact cause, but evidence suggests that letters written by Newton to several of his London<br>
                        acquaintances and friends, including Duillier, seemed deranged and paranoiac, and accused them of betrayal and conspiracy.
                        <br><BR>
                        Oddly enough, Newton recovered quickly, wrote letters of apology to friends, and was back to work within a few months.<br>
                        He emerged with all his intellectual facilities intact, but seemed to have lost interest in scientific problems and<br>
                        now favored pursuing prophecy and scripture and the study of alchemy. 
                        <br><BR>
                        While some might see this as work beneath the man who had revolutionized science, it might be more properly attributed to<br>
                        Newton responding to the issues of the time in turbulent 17th century Britain. 
                        <br><BR>
                        Many intellectuals were grappling with the meaning of many different subjects, not least of which were religion, politics<br>
                        and the very purpose of life. Modern science was still so new that no one knew for sure how it measured<br>
                        up against older philosophies.
                        <br><BR>
                        <b>Gold Standard</b><BR><BR>
                        In 1696, Newton was able to attain the governmental position he had long sought: warden of the Mint; after acquiring this new<br>
                        title, he permanently moved to London and lived with his niece, Catherine Barton. 
                        <br><BR>
                        Barton was the mistress of Lord Halifax, a high-ranking government official who was instrumental in having Newton promoted,<br>
                        in 1699, to master of the Mint—a position that he would hold until his death. 
                        <br><BR>
                        Not wanting it to be considered a mere honorary position, Newton approached the job in earnest, reforming the currency and<br>
                        severely punishing counterfeiters. As master of the Mint, Newton moved the British currency, the pound sterling,<br>
                        from the silver to the gold standard.
                        <br><BR>
                        <b>The Royal Society</b><BR><BR>
                        In 1703, Newton was elected president of the Royal Society upon Robert Hooke's death. However, Newton never seemed to<br>
                        understand the notion of science as a cooperative venture, and his ambition and fierce defense of his own discoveries<br>
                        continued to lead him from one conflict to another with other scientists. 
                        <br><BR>
                        By most accounts, Newton's tenure at the society was tyrannical and autocratic; he was able to control the lives and careers of<br>
                        younger scientists with absolute power.
                        <br><BR>
                        In 1705, in a controversy that had been brewing for several years, German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz publicly accused<br>
                        Newton of plagiarizing his research, claiming he had discovered infinitesimal calculus several<br>
                        years before the publication of Principia. 
                        <br><BR>
                        In 1712, the Royal Society appointed a committee to investigate the matter. Of course, since Newton was president of the<br>
                        society, he was able to appoint the committee's members and oversee its investigation. Not surprisingly, the committee<br>
                        concluded Newton's priority over the discovery.
                        <br><BR>
                        That same year, in another of Newton's more flagrant episodes of tyranny, he published without permission the notes of<br>
                        astronomer John Flamsteed. It seems the astronomer had collected a massive body of data from his years at the Royal<br>
                        Observatory at Greenwich, England. 
                        <br><BR>
                        Newton had requested a large volume of Flamsteed's notes for his revisions to Principia. Annoyed when Flamsteed wouldn't<br>
                        provide him with more information as quickly as he wanted it, Newton used his influence as president of the Royal Society<br>
                        to be named the chairman of the body of "visitors" responsible for the Royal Observatory.
                        <br><BR>
                        He then tried to force the immediate publication of Flamsteed's catalogue of the stars, as well as all of Flamsteed's notes, <br>
                        edited and unedited. To add insult to injury, Newton arranged for Flamsteed's mortal enemy, Edmund Halley,<br>
                        to prepare the notes for press. 
                        <br><BR>
                        Flamsteed was finally able to get a court order forcing Newton to cease his plans for publication and return the<br>
                        notes—one of the few times that Newton was bested by one of his rivals.
                        <br><BR>



                        <b>Final Years</b><BR><BR>
                        Toward the end of this life, Newton lived at Cranbury Park, near Winchester, England, with his niece, Catherine (Barton)<br>
                        Conduitt, and her husband, John Conduitt. 
                        <br><BR>
                        By this time, Newton had become one of the most famous men in Europe. His scientific discoveries were unchallenged.<br>
                        He also had become wealthy, investing his sizable income wisely and bestowing sizable gifts to charity. 
                        <br><BR>
                        Despite his fame, Newton's life was far from perfect: He never married or made many friends, and in his later years, a combination of pride, insecurity and side trips on peculiar scientific inquiries led even some of his few friends<br>
                        to worry about his mental stability.
                        <br><BR>

                        <b>Death</b><BR><BR>
                        By the time he reached 80 years of age, Newton was experiencing digestion problems and had to drastically change<br>
                        his diet and mobility. 
                        <br><BR>
                        In March 1727, Newton experienced severe pain in his abdomen and blacked out, never to regain consciousness. He died<br>
                        the next day, on March 31, 1727, at the age of 84.
                        <br><BR>

                        <b>Legacy</b><BR><BR>  
                        Newton's fame grew even more after his death, as many of his contemporaries proclaimed him the greatest genius who ever<br>
                        lived. Maybe a slight exaggeration, but his discoveries had a large impact on Western thought, leading to comparisons<br>
                        to the likes of Plato, Aristotle and Galileo.
                        <br><BR>
                        Although his discoveries were among many made during the Scientific Revolution, Newton's universal principles of gravity<br>
                        found no parallels in science at the time. 
                        <br><BR>
                        Of course, Newton was proven wrong on some of his key assumptions. In the 20th century, <a style="color: red;" href="Albert Einstein.html">Albert Einstein</a> would overturn<br>
                        Newton's concept of the universe, stating that space, distance and motion were not absolute but relative and<br>
                        that the universe was more fantastic than Newton had ever conceived.
                        <br><BR>
                        Newton might not have been surprised: In his later life, when asked for an assessment of his achievements, he replied,<br>
                        "I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on<br>
                        the seashore, and diverting myself now and then in finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary,<br>
                        while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."
